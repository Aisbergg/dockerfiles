# DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE!!! #
##############################
# By default this file is automatically generated on container startup.
# To disable the autogeneration simply change the first line of this file to
# 'autogen false'.
# All paths listed in this files will be saved persistently so they will be
# restored on container recreation. This is necessary for only those files and
# dirs, that are not stored in a docker volume. You can add paths here if you
# need to, but they need to be valid paths, otherwise the saving mechanism will
# fail and you will loose all new data. After changes are made, make sure you
# set 'autogen false' and restart the saving mechanism with 'supervisorctl
# restart container-keep-files'. When the last command returns successfully then
# everything is great.
